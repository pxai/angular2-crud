```

You may need to install node modules

npm install
```

## Transpile and watch
Just type this on console:
```
npm start
```
If concurrent or lite-server does not work properly, just run them in different consoles.
This will run typescript transpilation and set a watch on any further changes
```
npm run tsc:w
```
And this runs a little web server with a rest API
```
npm rest
```
Or directly:
```
node restserver
```
